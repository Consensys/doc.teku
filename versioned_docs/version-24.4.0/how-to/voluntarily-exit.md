# Voluntarily exit a validator

A voluntary exit is when a validator chooses to stop performing its duties, and exits the Beacon Chain permanently.

To voluntarily exit, the validator must continue performing its validator duties until successfully exited to avoid penalties.

:::caution important

To voluntarily exit, you must have a running beacon node with the [REST API enabled].

:::

:::warning

A validator **cannot** rejoin the network once it voluntarily exits. You can set up a new validator with the withdrawn funds.

:::

## Initiate a voluntary exit

Use the [`voluntary-exit`](../reference/cli/subcommands/voluntary-exit.md) subcommand to initiate a voluntary exit for specified validators.

```bash title="Example"
teku voluntary-exit                                \
  --beacon-node-api-endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:5051 \
  --validator-keys=validator/keys/validator_1e9f2a.json:validator/passwords/validator_1e9f2a.txt
```

In the command:

- Specify the location of the beacon node using the
  [`--beacon-node-api-endpoint`](../reference/cli/subcommands/voluntary-exit.md#beacon-node-api-endpoint) option.
- Specify the validators to exit using the
  [`--validator-keys`](../reference/cli/subcommands/voluntary-exit.md#validator-keys) option.
- Specify the earliest epoch at which to exit using the
  [`--epoch`](../reference/cli/subcommands/voluntary-exit.md#epoch) option.
  If not specified, the default value is the current epoch.
  You cannot specify a future epoch.

If using an external signer such as [Web3Signer], then specify the external signer URL and public key of the exiting validator:

```bash title="Example"
teku voluntary-exit                                      \
  --beacon-node-api-endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:5051       \
  --validators-external-signer-url=http://localhost:9000 \
  --validators-external-signer-public-keys=1e9f2afcc0737f4502e8d4238e4fe82d45077b2a549902b61d65367acecbccba
```

Use the [`/eth/v1/beacon/pool/voluntary_exits`](https://consensys.github.io/teku/#operation/getEthV1BeaconPoolVoluntary_exits) API to check the pending exit queue.

## Create but don't submit an exit

Use the [`voluntary-exit`](../reference/cli/subcommands/voluntary-exit.md) subcommand to create a
signed exit for the specified validators, but not submit it to the beacon node.

```bash title="Example"
teku voluntary-exit                                \
  --beacon-node-api-endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:5051 \
  --save-exits-path=.                              \
  --validator-keys=validator/keys/validator_1e9f2a.json:validator/passwords/validator_1e9f2a.txt
```

In the command:

- Specify the location of the beacon node using the
  [`--beacon-node-api-endpoint`](../reference/cli/subcommands/voluntary-exit.md#beacon-node-api-endpoint) option.
- Specify the validators to exit using the
  [`--validator-keys`](../reference/cli/subcommands/voluntary-exit.md#validator-keys) option.
- Specify the path at which to save the generated exit messages using the
  [`--save-exits-path`](../reference/cli/subcommands/voluntary-exit.md#save-exits-path) option.

In this example, a JSON file is written to the current folder (`.`) containing a signed exit message
for validator `1e9f2a`.
At a future time when this exit needs to be processed, you can use the beacon API to submit
this message using a POST request to `/eth/v1/beacon/voluntary_exits`.
