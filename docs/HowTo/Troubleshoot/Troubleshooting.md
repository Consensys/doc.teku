# Troubleshooting

## Out of memory error

If Teku exits with a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error, it could mean that Teku's
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) ran out of memory.

To fix this, you can try [setting a maximum heap size].

## P2P port conflicts

If Teku fails to start with a `P2P Port 9000 (TCP/UDP) is already in use. Check for other processes
using this port.` error, it means that Teku is trying to use a network port that is already in
use.

For example, Teku and Lighthouse both use port 9000 by default for P2P traffic. You can change
Teku's default port number with the [`--p2p-port`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#p2p-port)
option.

## Unable to lock a keystore file

If Teku fails to start with an `Unexpected error when trying to lock a keystore file` error, this
could be because the directory containing the keystores is not writable by Teku.

Teku uses a file locking mechanism for the keystores to prevent two validator clients using the same
keystores at the same time.

To resolve this issue, try the one of the following:

* Set the permissions of the directory holding the keystores so that it is writable by Teku.
* Set [`--validators-keystore-locking-enabled`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#validators-keystore-locking-enabled)
    to `false` to disable the locking functionality.

!!! important

    Ensure no other process or clients are using your keys. If they are, you could get [slashed].

## Keystore file already in use

If Teku fails to start with a `Keystore file <keystore_file>.lock already in use.` error, this
could mean the keystore file is already being used by a validator client, or Teku has exited
unexpectedly and did not remove the lock.

Teku uses a file locking mechanism for the keystores to prevent two validator clients using the same
keystores at the same time.

To resolve this issue, try the one of the following:

* Manually remove the lock files that are created alongside your keystore files, with `.lock`
    appended to the filename. Take care not to delete your keystores.
* Set [`--validators-keystore-locking-enabled`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#validators-keystore-locking-enabled)
    to `false` to disable the locking functionality.

!!! important

    Ensure no other process or clients are using your keys. If they are, you could get [slashed].

## Keystore files are loading slowly

Teku supports `scrypt` or `pbkdf2` formatted keystores. Both keystore formats are supported by
[EIP-2335].

The `scrypt` formatted keystores load slower and require more memory to load, whereas `pbkdf2`
formatted keystores load instantly.

The `scrypt` formatted keystores are more secure because they require more resources to crack. To
improve the loading times of your keystores, you can convert them to the `pbkdf2` format.

## Unable to read YAML configuration

If Teku fails to start with the following:

```lang-none
Unable to read yaml configuration. Invalid yaml file [config.yaml]:
java.io.CharConversionException: Invalid UTF-8 start byte 0x93 (at char #11, byte #-1) at [Source: (File); line: 1, column: 1]
```

This could mean that the word processor has inserted smart quotes instead of straight quotes. Use
straight quotes only.

## Validators not making attestations

Check whether your validator's attestations are being included in blocks at [`BeaconCha.in`](https://beaconcha.in/).

!!! note

    Occasional missed attestations are normal on a P2P network, but they should be a few percent.

If all recent attestations are marked as missed, check the following:

* **Did the validators load correctly?**

    Check the logs when Teku started for the line,
    `teku-status-log | Loaded N Validators: <validator_pubkey>[, <validator_pubkey>]`, where `N` is
    the number of expected validators. Each validator's truncated public key is also listed.

    If the validator did not load, check for any errors loading the validator, and that the
    [`--validators-keys`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#validators-keys) option is
    correct.

* **Is the beacon node still syncing?**

    Validators can only attest when the beacon node is in sync. If you see lines similar to,
    `teku-event-log | Sync Event  *** Current slot: 239418, Head slot: 123456`, then the node is
    still syncing.

    Syncing is complete when the head slot reaches the current slot. If the node is synced, the
    messages are similar to,
    `teku-event-log | Slot Event  *** Slot: 716614, Block: acef76..c61b, Epoch: 22394...`.

* **Is the beacon node reporting attestations?**

    Each validator that you run prints the message, `teku-validator-log | Validator   *** Published
    attestation  Count: 1, Slot: 48539, Root: 5e1bf5..cee8` once each epoch. If you do not see this
    for your validator then check that it loaded correctly.

    To see this message, ensure
    [`log-include-validator-duties-enabled`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#log-include-validator-duties-enabled) is `true`.

* **Do you have peers?**

    The nodes's peer count is printed at the end of each slot event in the log.
    [Ensure your local network is configured correctly] to allow the node to listen for incoming P2P
    connections and discover peers.

## UnsatisfiedLinkError when starting Teku

If Teku fails to start with the following error:

```bash
Teku failed to start.
java.util.concurrent.CompletionException: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /tmp/librocksdbjni8697586722914603821.so...
```

This could be due to your `/tmp` directory being marked non-executable (`noexec`).

To resolve this, try one of the following:

* Remove `noexec` on the `/tmp` mount. This can be done permanently in the
    file systems table (`fstab`), or temporarily using the command `sudo mount /tmp -o remount,exec`

* Create a new temporary folder for applications to use within the shell.

    ```bash
    mkdir tmp
    export TMPDIR=`pwd`/tmp
    ```

## Command line options

On Linux, shell processing of paths do not work when specified like this:

```bash
./teku --config-file=~/config.yaml
```

The shell does not see the tilde (~) in the command. To fix this, omit the equals sign (=).

```bash
./teku --config-file ~/config.yaml
```
