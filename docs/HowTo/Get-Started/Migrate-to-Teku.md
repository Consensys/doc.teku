# Migrate to Teku

Migrate from a different Ethereum consensus client to Teku to contribute to [client diversity](https://clientdiversity.org/).

When migrating from a different client, consider the following:

- You might need to update your ports.
- You can [import a slashing protection database](../../Reference/CLI/Subcommands/Slashing-Protection.md#import).
- You might need to update your key management information.
  Teku supports [using Web3Signer](../External-Signer/Use-External-Signer.md).

Find guides to switch from specific clients on the [client diversity website](https://clientdiversity.org/#switch).
