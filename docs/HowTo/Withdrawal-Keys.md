title: How to update your withdrawal credentials

# Update your withdrawal credentials

When you create a validator, itâ€™s currently possible to set its [withdrawal](../Concepts/Withdrawals.md) address
to a BLS address, or an Ethereum address. After the Capella fork, users must use an Ethereum address as their withdrawal
address to allow automatics transfers.

## Determine the withdrawal address type

**Prerequisites**:

- Access to the beacon node API endpoint. By default this is `localhost:5051`
- Install [`curl`](https://curl.se/) and [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

The following shell script allows you to determine the withdrawal address of a given validator ID.

=== "Script"

    ```bash
    VALIDATOR=<VALIDATOR_INDEX> \
    curl http://localhost:5051/eth/v1/beacon/states/finalized/validators/$VALIDATOR | jq '.data | .validator.withdrawal_credentials'
    ```

=== "Example output

    ```
    "0x00fc40352b0a186d83267fc1342ec5da49dbb78e1099a4bd8db16d2c0d223594"
    ```

In the script, specify the `<VALIDATOR_INDEX>` (for example `1`) that was provided when you joined the network. Alternatively
you can specify the validator's public key.

In the output, the first 4 characters of the string, in this case `0x00`, indicates the key is a BLS withdrawal
key.

## Update your withdrawal address

### From a BLS withdrawal address to an Ethereum address

!!! important

    Teku does not offer functionality to update your withdrawal key from a BLS withdrawal address to
    an Ethereum address. Use a tool like [`ethdo`](https://github.com/wealdtech/ethdo/blob/master/docs/changingwithdrawalcredentials.md)
    instead.

If your withdrawal address is a BLS key (starts with `0x00`), the Capella fork provides a process to
update your withdrawal address to a `0x01` withdrawal key (Ethereum address).
You must have the BLS withdrawal address private key, or the seed phrase (mnemonic) to sign the request
to prove that you have access to the BLS withdrawal key.

Tools such as [ethdo](https://github.com/wealdtech/ethdo/blob/master/docs/changingwithdrawalcredentials.md) are able to sign the request correctly,
and the signed data can be submitted directly, or via your own beacon node.

!!! important "Important information about changing withdrawal credentials"

    - Once a validator has been updated to use a `0x01` withdrawal key (Ethereum address), it cannot be changed again.
    - Updating your withdrawal credentials is not available until the Capella fork is active.
    - Ensure you update to the expected Ethereum address because the change is permanent.
    - The updated address will receive a direct deposited for 0 gas, but no EVM code will be executed
        as part of the transaction.

A maximum of 16 validator keys can update their withdrawal credentials per block, so the process may
be congested initially. If you submit a request to update your key, and it hasn't been done in a period
of time, you might consider re-submitting the request. It may take several epochs for the change to be
included in a block, depending on the number of requests in the queue.

Query the [`bls_to_execution_changes`](https://consensys.github.io/teku/#tag/Beacon/operation/getBlsToExecutionChanges)
API see if your request is still in the pool.

### Update your Ethereum address

To update an Ethereum address, you'll need to create a new validator key. You can exit your current
validator key as a voluntary exit, and use the funds from the full withdrawal of that to create the
new validator key.

The voluntary exit process takes while to complete, and the exiting validator must remain active during that
time to avoid inactivity penalties.

!!! important

    Ensure that you own, or have access to the current Ethereum address before exiting, otherwise you
    will be unable to access your funds.
