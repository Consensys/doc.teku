# Proof of stake

[The Merge](Merge.md) transitions Ethereum Mainnet to
[proof of stake (PoS)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/) consensus.

In Ethereum's PoS, you must run a [full node](Merge.md#execution-and-consensus-clients) and
[stake 32 ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/) to become a validator.

!!! important

    Withdrawing staked ETH isn't yet supported and will be included in a separate upgrade following The Merge.

The PoS mechanism randomly chooses validators to propose or validate blocks on the
[Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/beacon-chain/) (consensus blocks) in defined time frames (slots).

Proposers are responsible for proposing new consensus blocks, and non-proposing validators are responsible for
validating (attesting to) proposed blocks.
Validators are rewarded for proposing and attesting to consensus blocks eventually included in the Beacon Chain, and
their stake is slashed if they fail to validate or if they attest to malicious blocks, incentivizing good behavior.

Each consensus block contains an execution payload, which contains a list of transactions and other data required to
execute and validate the payload.

When a node validates a consensus block, its [consensus client](Merge.md#execution-and-consensus-clients) processes
the block and sends the execution payload to the [execution client](Merge.md#execution-and-consensus-clients), which:

1. Assembles a block on the execution layer (execution block).
1. Verifies pre-conditions.
1. Executes transactions.
1. Verifies post-conditions.
1. Sends the validity result back to the consensus client.

If the block is valid, the execution client includes it in the execution chain and stores the new state in execution
state storage.

If at least 128 validators attest to a consensus block within a slot, it's included in the Beacon Chain.
