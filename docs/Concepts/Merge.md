# The Merge

The Ethereum upgrade known as [The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) will merge the [Beacon Chain] into
Ethereum Mainnet, turning Mainnet into a combination of an
[execution layer and consensus layer](#execution-and-consensus-clients).
The Merge will transition Mainnet from proof of work to [proof of stake consensus](Proof-of-Stake.md).

## Execution and consensus clients

After The Merge, a full Ethereum Mainnet node will be a combination of an execution client (previously called an
[Ethereum 1.0](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/) client) and a consensus client (previously
called an [Ethereum 2.0](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/) client).

Execution and consensus clients communicate with each other using the
[Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/specification.md).

### Execution clients

Execution clients, such as [Besu], manage the state and execute transactions on the execution layer.
Execution clients serve [JSON-RPC API](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/) requests and
communicate with each other in a peer-to-peer network

### Consensus clients

Consensus clients, such as Teku, contain beacon node and validator client implementations.
The beacon node is the primary link to the [Beacon Chain] (consensus layer).
The validator client performs [validator duties](Proof-of-Stake.md) on the consensus layer.
Consensus clients serve [REST API](../Reference/Rest_API/Rest.md) requests and communicate with each other in a
peer-to-peer network.

### Run a node

After The Merge, a Mainnet node operator must run both an execution client and a beacon node at the same time.
To become a validator, you must also run a validator client (either
[in the same process as the beacon node](../HowTo/Get-Started/Run-Teku.md#start-the-clients-in-a-single-process) or
[separately](../HowTo/Get-Started/Run-Teku.md#run-the-clients-separately).

You can [test Teku with Besu on the Kiln Merge testnet](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Merge-Testnet/).

You can [run Teku with Besu on Ethereum Mainnet](../HowTo/Get-Started/Connect/Connect-To-Mainnet.md).
