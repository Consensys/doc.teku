# Teku architecture

The following diagram outlines the Teku high-level architecture.

![Architecture](../images/Architecture.png)

Teku contains both a beacon node and validator client implementation.
The beacon node is the primary link to the Beacon Chain.
The validator client performs [validator duties](Proof-of-Stake.md).

You can [run the beacon node only](../HowTo/Get-Started/Run-Teku.md#start-the-beacon-node), or
[run the beacon node and validator client](../HowTo/Get-Started/Run-Teku.md#start-the-clients-in-a-single-process).
